# Qt Number Guessing Game
This is a simple yet engaging Qt GUI application that allows the user to play a number guessing game.

## **Objective of this Code**
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to create an interactive game using Qt and C++. The main objectives of this project are:

Generate a random secret number between a specified range.
Allow the user to input their guesses via a spin box.
Display messages to guide the user if their guess is too high or too low.
Declare the user's victory if they correctly guess the secret number.
Enable resetting the game for new rounds of guessing.
This project shows the use of Qt's signal-slot mechanism, random number generation, and GUI manipulation based on user interaction.

## **What I Learnt**
Through this project, I learnt:

How to create a simple game logic using C++.
Handling user interaction in a Qt GUI application.
Using Qt's signal-slot mechanism for button clicks and game logic.
Implementing random number generation in C++.
Manipulating GUI elements dynamically based on game status.


## **Where This Will Help Me**
This project adds to my repertoire of creating interactive GUI applications using the Qt framework and C++. The knowledge gained from creating this game logic and implementing it in a GUI application will help in understanding and developing more complex game algorithms and interactive applications. This project also enhances my understanding of user interaction in GUI applications and real-time GUI manipulation.![Guess The Number! 6_15_2023 8_38_55 PM](https://github.com/HayatDahraj11/QTIntro_GuessTheNumberGame-/assets/99029950/fb15031b-31ff-41d1-801b-e119f8c5a53c)
